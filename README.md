# DB-Restore-Windows-App
Incredibly Mediocre Windows application to Backup and Restore Databases (Local or network)

# Coding Guidelines

# Git

I prefer a rebase workflow and **No** feature branches. Most work happens directly on the master branch. For that reason, I recommend setting the pull.rebase setting to true.

`git config --global pull.rebase true`

# Indentation
Please, No space, only TABS.

# Names

1. Use PascalCase for type names
2. Use PascalCase for enum values
3. Use camelCase for function and method names
4. Use camelCase for property names and local variables
5. Use whole words in names when possible
   
# Strings

1. Use "double quotes" for strings shown to the user that need to be externalized (localized)
2. Use 'single quotes' otherwise
3. All strings visible to the user need to be externalized



**Original Work credit goes to User - [@alnotas](https://github.com/alnotas) Repo - https://github.com/alnotas/SQLBR**
*Restore is my work and Added small features to it, I know I could have forked it and then worked on it but I somehow didn't pay attention to it and Cloned the repo from @alnotas and then worked on it, finally I had to make a new repo of my own and push everything there since I don't have the permission to push any changes to the @alnotas repo.*
